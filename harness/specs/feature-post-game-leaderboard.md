# Feature: Post-game leaderboard registration

## Problem
Players should register a trustworthy game-produced result without typing the result themselves.

## Scope
- After a completed run, ask whether to register the result.
- If accepted, ask only for a 1-20 character player name.
- Submit tiny-mines using metric time; ranking uses shortest completion time.
- Keep gameplay available if the network is unavailable or registration is declined.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The prompt appears once per completed run.
- Declining or failing submission never blocks restart or continued play.
- The submitted numeric result comes from game state, not player input.
- Blank or oversized names are rejected.
- A successful or failed submission gives visible feedback.
- Opening the mobile keyboard for the name field does not push or resize the game screen behind the dialog.
- Flutter tests and harness audit pass.

## Constraints
- Submission is optional and is the only online dependency.
- Only the Supabase publishable key may ship in the client.
- Existing gameplay rules remain unchanged.

## Evidence
- flutter test
- harness audit
